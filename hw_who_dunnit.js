Episode 1

const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Library',
  weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

//Answer
Miss Scarlet as the function returns the murderer object within the scenario array.
//end

Episode 2

const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

//Answer
This will error out as the second function is trying to change the constant murderer variable to 'Mrs. Peacock'.
//end

Episode 3

let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);

//Answer
The fist verdict in Mrs. Peacock as the declareMurderer function sets the murderer let to Mrs. Peacock and returns it in a string interpulation.
The second verdict would return Professor Plum as the let murderer variable within the declareMurderer function is restricted to within the function.
//end

Episode 4

let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);

//Answer
The first log would output "The suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard.".
The second log would output "Suspect three is Mrs. Peacock." because the let's outside the function can not be altered by the let variable inside the function.
//end

Episode 5

const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
}

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);

//Answer
The verdict will be "The weapon in the Candle Stick." because the array is set as a constant and can not be changed. It might error before that and stop the function.
//end

Episode 6

let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
